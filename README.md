## üöÄ Key Features

QuickNote isn't just another text editor. It's meticulously crafted to be an extension of your mind, ready to capture thoughts frictionlessly and boost your productivity.

### Core Experience & Performance
*   ‚ö°Ô∏è **Instant Global Access:** Summon a new note or toggle your workspace from anywhere in your OS with customizable global hotkeys. Capture ideas the moment they strike, without ever leaving your current context.
*   üí® **Native Performance, Feather-light Footprint:** Built with a Rust backend and a Tauri core, QuickNote launches instantly and runs with minimal CPU and memory usage. Experience native speed and responsiveness that web-based apps can't match.
*   üß† **Focus-Aware Activation:** When you summon QuickNote via a shortcut, it intelligently brings itself to the foreground and stays on top temporarily, ensuring you can start typing immediately without the window disappearing.

### Intuitive & Modern Interface
*   üóÇÔ∏è **Advanced Tab Management:** Organize your thoughts with a powerful tabbed interface. Effortlessly **drag-and-drop** to reorder tabs, **double-click to rename**, and see unsaved changes at a glance with a visual indicator (`‚Ä¢`).
*   ‚úçÔ∏è **Minimalist yet Powerful Editor:** A clean, distraction-free writing environment featuring essential tools like **line numbers** and proper **tab indentation** support, helping you focus on what matters: your content.
*   üåì **Dynamic Theming:** Seamlessly switch between a beautiful **Light** and a comfortable **Dark** theme. Your choice is saved and applied instantly, adapting the entire UI to your preference.
*   üñºÔ∏è **Sleek Frameless Design (macOS):** Enjoy a modern, unified aesthetic on macOS with a custom frameless window and fully functional, integrated **"traffic light"** controls for a truly native feel.
*   üìÇ **Drag & Drop to Open:** Simply drag files from your desktop or file explorer and drop them onto the QuickNote window to open them in new tabs instantly.

### Powerful Customization
*   ‚å®Ô∏è **Fully Configurable Global Hotkeys:** Take full control of your workflow by customizing the keyboard shortcuts for creating a new note, closing a tab, and showing/hiding the application window.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Workflow Preferences:** Streamline your process by setting a **default save path** for new notes and choosing a **default file format** (`.txt`, `.md`, etc.), minimizing repetitive actions.
*   üåê **Multi-Language Interface:** Switch between **English** and **Traditional Chinese** on-the-fly. The entire UI, from settings to status bar, will update instantly.

### Advanced Workflow & Productivity
*   üíæ **Smart Save System:** QuickNote is smart about saving. It uses `Save` for existing files and automatically prompts `Save As...` for new, untitled notes, ensuring you never accidentally overwrite the wrong file.
*   üõ°Ô∏è **Unsaved Changes Protection:** Never lose your work again. QuickNote will warn you and ask for confirmation before closing a tab with unsaved changes.
*   üì¶ **Intelligent System Tray Menu:** Access core functions without even opening the window. The tray icon provides quick actions for "New Note", "Save", and more, plus a dynamic list of **Recently Closed Files** for one-click reopening.
*   üìö **Batch File Opening:** Select and open multiple files at once from the file dialog. QuickNote will neatly open each file in its own new tab, ready for you to work on.
